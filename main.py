# 1. Story Generation System
def generate_base_story(theme, age_range, learning_style):
    """Generate the initial story with adaptable elements."""
    prompt = f"""
    Create a children's story based on the theme: {theme}.  

  

Tailor the story for the selected age group: {age_range}. 

- For ages 3-5: Use simple sentences, no paragraphs, larger text format, and include repetition or rhyming to support comprehension. Keep the story short (100-150 words). 

- For ages 5-7: Introduce short paragraphs, a clear beginning, middle, and end, and use a slightly larger font. Add engaging dialogue or questions to involve the child. 

- For ages 7-9: Add richer vocabulary, more detailed descriptions, and multi-paragraph storytelling with an easy-to-follow plot.  

- For ages 9-11: Include complex sentences, imaginative world-building, and relatable themes that foster critical thinking and creativity. 

  

Customize the story for the chosen learning style: {learning_style}. 

- For visual learners: Incorporate emojis, visual descriptions, and exclamations to stimulate imagination. For example: "ðŸŒŸ The stars twinkled brightly in the night sky!" Use vivid imagery to enhance engagement. 

- For auditory learners: Focus on rhythm, rhyme, and onomatopoeia. Use sound-related cues like "BAM!" or "whoosh" to make the story engaging. Structure sentences to flow naturally when read aloud. 

- For kinesthetic learners: Include action-oriented descriptions and prompts for interactive engagement, such as "Clap your hands when the hero cheers!" or "Pretend to jump over the log like the character!" 

  

Ensure the story includes a clear moral or learning outcome to foster both entertainment and education. 

  

Output the story in a format optimized for the age group and learning style, including spacing, layout, and interactivity when applicable.
